# Trendy Tunnels MT5

Trendy Tunnels MT5 is a Forex trading strategy tool developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to identify trends in the market and generate trade signals based on moving averages and the Average Directional Index (ADX) indicator.

## Input Parameters

- MA1_Period: Period for the first moving average (default: 20)
- MA2_Period: Period for the second moving average (default: 40)
- ADX_Period: Period for the ADX indicator (default: 14)
- ADX_Threshold: ADX threshold for trend confirmation (default: 25.0)

## Functionality

The code consists of several functions that work together to execute the trading strategy.

### OnTick() Function

This function is called on each tick of the price data. It performs the following actions:

1. Calculates the values of the two moving averages (MA1_Value and MA2_Value) using the iMA() function.
2. Calculates the upper and lower boundaries of the tunnels based on the moving average values.
3. Retrieves the value of the ADX indicator (ADX_Value) using the iADX() function.
4. Checks if the trend is confirmed based on the ADX value being above the threshold.
5. Generates trade signals to go long or short if the price is above the upper tunnel or below the lower tunnel, respectively.
6. Checks for open trades and adjusts stop-loss and take-profit levels if necessary.
7. Checks for trade closure conditions and closes open trades if the conditions are met.

### TradeSignal() Function

This function is called to generate trade signals based on the identified trend. It takes a string parameter 'signal' which specifies the type of signal (BUY or SELL). Depending on the signal, it opens a long or short position using the OrderSend() function.

### AdjustTradeLevels() Function

This function is called to adjust the stop-loss and take-profit levels of open trades. It iterates through all open trades and uses the OrderModify() function to modify the levels based on the upper and lower tunnel values.

### IsTradeClosureConditionMet() Function

This function is called to check if the conditions for closing open trades are met. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the conditions are met. The specific conditions for trade closure can be implemented based on the trading strategy.

### CloseOpenTrades() Function

This function is called to close all open trades. It iterates through all open trades and uses the OrderClose() function to close the trades.
